Code for "PFMap Developing web-based data analysis tools for
precision farming using R and Shiny"

Technologies that are set to increase the productivity of agricultural practices require
more and more data. Nevertheless, farming data is also being increasingly cheap to collect and
maintain. Bulk of data that are collected by the sensors and samples need to be analysed in an
efficient and transparent manner. Web technologies have long being used to develop
applications that can assist the farmers and managers. However until recently, analysing the
data in an online environment has not been an easy task especially in the eyes of data analysts.
This barrier is now overcome by the availability of new application programming interfaces
that can provide real-time web based data analysis. In this paper developing a prototype web
based application for data analysis using new facilities in R statistical package and its web
development facility, Shiny is explored. The pros and cons of this type of data analysis
environment for precision farming are enumerated and future directions in web application
development for agricultural data are discussed.
